# Test Taker's Toolkit


A quick and dirty Android application designed to streamline the process of water quality testing. This toolkit allows technicians and testers to easily record customer information, water test results, and automagically generate professional PDF reports.

# Features

 - **Customer Data Management:** Quickly enter and manage customer details, including name, address, and contact information.
 - **Detailed Test Results:** Input values for a wide range of water quality parameters, such as Hardness, pH, TDS, Iron, Nitrates, and more.
 - **Water Source Specification:** Specify the water source (Municipal, Private Well, Community Well) and automatically fetch and display relevant data like the IL EPA System Number based on the customer's ZIP code. (Central Illinois only at this time)
 - **Instant PDF Generation:** Create clean and shareable PDF reports of the test results.
 - **Persistent Company Information:** Set your company's name, and contact details to automatically brand generated reports.
 - **Modern UI/UX:** UI featuring both a light "Aquatic" theme (for psychopaths) and a "Solarized Dark" based theme for user comfort.
